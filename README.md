# Hi! I'm Simon!

I am a full-time software engineer. 

At the moment I am working on the [ARTIQ quantum control system](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq) developed and maintained by [M-Labs](https://m-labs.hk/). 

I previously worked mainly on the Python frontend, the `PyQt` and `asyncio` based GUI as well as the other CLI tools in the software suite. Currently, most of my work revolves around upgrading and fixing subtle bugs in our [Zynq7000 simple bootloader](https://git.m-labs.hk/m-labs/zynq-rs) and [ARTIQ firmware](https://git.m-labs.hk/m-labs/artiq-zynq).
