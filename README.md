# Hi! I'm Simon!

I am a full-time software engineer. 

Currently I am working on the [ARTIQ software](https://github.com/m-labs/artiq) being developed at [M-Labs](https://m-labs.hk/). 

I am currently implementing solutions related to concurrency (asyncio) and networking (TCP and RPC servers) as well as GUI (PyQt). Everything in Linux of course :).

In my spare time I am currently learning a bit of OCaml and dipping my fingers in x86 assembly.
